Currency Converter Application
This project is a Windows Forms-based Currency Converter application built using C# and .NET Framework. It allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using live exchange rates fetched from an API. The application includes a custom implementation to handle conversions involving the Nepalese Rupee (NPR), which is not available in the API response.

Features
Live Currency Exchange Rates: Fetches real-time rates from the ExchangeRate-API or ExchangeRate.host.
Simple and Intuitive UI: User-friendly interface for selecting base and target currencies and entering the amount to convert.
Custom NPR Support: Adds support for NPR (Nepalese Rupee) with predefined exchange rates.
Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs and network errors gracefully.
Dynamic Dropdowns: Fetches and populates currency options dynamically.
